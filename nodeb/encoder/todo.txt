6-10-10
-------
- still need to validate the CRC 24_A table
- stopped at the segmentation of blocks, func BlkSeg (hideous stuff!!)
- finish the adhoc Append function

- as far as a turbo encoder is concerned us the RSC version

6-18-10
-------
- reformat CRC tables
- fixed the crc test to handle the CRC slice return value

6-19-10
-------
- validated the orphan bit crcs
- started writings tests for the adhoc methods

6-21-10
-------
- validated the Rsh method via TestRsh but it needs to be refactored
- finished the adhoc.go file, but the scope of the unit tests need to be expanded

6-22-10
-------
- left off at the BlkSeg function, the blkseg buffer creation needs to change
  so that each segment slice is an independant slice and not a park of any
  contiguous buffer, because of the way the addhoc functions work
